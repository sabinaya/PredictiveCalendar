PredictiveCalendar
==================
The Application does prediction to tell the user if there are any problems on each day of his calendar events considering factors like weather, city events and road construction. It can tell you where you need to go to a regularly scheduled meeting, if you have been to that place before, and how to get there.

e.g., I schedule an appointment 3 months from now to go to the doctor, knowing that on an average day it will take me about 20 minutes to get there. As the date comes closer, the app would look at other relevant data feeds (city events, new road construction, weather), and suggest changes to my plans to make sure I get to the doctor on time. This would take into account how I prefer to drive, which is where the learning comes in.
